    <h2>Some info about autonomous vehicles</h2>
    <p>ACs have the potential to impact the automotive industry, mobility costs, health, welfare, urban planning,
        traffic, insurance, labor markets, and other domains. Appropriate regulations are necessary to integrate ACs
        into the existing driving environment.
        Multiple vendors are pursuing autonomy, but as of early 2024, no system has achieved full autonomy. Waymo was
        the first to offer rides in self-driving taxis to the public,[7] and as of April 2024 offers services in Arizona
        (Phoenix) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles).
        Cruise offered taxi service in San Francisco,[8] but suspended service in 2023. In 2021, Honda was the first
        manufacturer to sell an SAE Level 3 car,[9][10][11] followed by Mercedes-Benz in 2023.[12] Baidu started
        offering robotaxi service in China in 2023. Other companies include DeepRoute.ai and Pony.ai.
