    <h1>History and Ethical Implications of Autonomous Cars</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Autonomous cars, also known as self-driving cars or driverless cars, have a history dating back several
            decades. The concept of autonomous vehicles emerged in the 1920s with experiments conducted by engineers and
            researchers. However, significant advancements in technology were made in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to
            the development of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous prototypes.</p>

        <p>Today, autonomous cars are becoming a reality, with companies like Tesla, Google (Waymo), Uber, and
            traditional automakers investing heavily in their development. These vehicles use a combination of sensors,
            cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence to navigate roads and make decisions without human intervention.
        </p>
        <p> In fact, since 2018 the number of vehicles equipped with hardware for fully autonomous driving has increased
            by 443%. So in recent years there has been significant developement and adoption that we can only assume
            will continue into the future. </p>

        <p>While autonomous cars offer potential benefits such as improved safety, reduced traffic congestion, and
            increased accessibility for people with disabilities, they also raise ethical concerns. One of the most
            significant ethical dilemmas is the issue of decision-making in critical situations. For example, if an
            autonomous car detects an imminent collision, how should it prioritize the safety of its occupants versus
            pedestrians or other vehicles?</p>

        <p> Should a fully autonomous vehicle be trained to make descisions which reflect produce the most common good
            for society even if it is at the expense of its owner, or should the fully autonomous vehicle be trained to
            make the descsion which best protects its owner even if it is at the expense of others?</p>
        <p> These types of questions must be at the forefront of our minds as we move into a new era where fully
            autonomous vehicles become a reality.</p>
        <p> Other ethical considerations include data privacy and security, liability in accidents involving autonomous
            vehicles, job displacement for drivers, and the potential for increased urban sprawl and environmental
            impacts. </p>
        <p> All in all, the history of autonomous cars is marked by significant technological advancements, but their
            widespread adoption raises complex ethical questions that society must address. As autonomous technology
            continues to evolve, policymakers, ethicists, and engineers must work together to ensure that these vehicles
            are developed and deployed in a manner that prioritizes safety, fairness, and ethical principles.</p>
