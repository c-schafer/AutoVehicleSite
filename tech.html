    <h1>Five Levels of Autonomous Driving</h1>
    <ul id="level-boxes">
        <li class="level-box">Some safety features, such as lane assist, are included in the vehicle. Adaptive cruise
            control may be included, as well as emergency braking.</li>
        <li class="level-box">Adaptive cruise control and other Level 1 features are included, but blind spot detection,
            automated parking, and sometimes traffic sign recognition are included as well.</li>
        <li class="level-box">Level 3 is what we usually consider "self-driving." The vehicle can accelerate, brake,
            steer, park, navigate traffic signs and signals, and more, using complex algorithms.</li>
        <li class="level-box">Once vehicles reach Level 4 automation, human drivers are rarely needed to take over. They
            can manage complex and difficult situations. Waymo Taxis fit into this category.</li>
        <li class="level-box">With full automation, a human driver is entirely unnecessary. Theoretically, a Level 5
            vehicle can operate safely under any conditions, but no company has reached this stage yet.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul id="level-labels">
        <li class="level-label">Level 1</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 2</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 3</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 4</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 5</li>
    </ul>
