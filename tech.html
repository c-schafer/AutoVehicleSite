    <h1>Five Levels of Autonomous Driving</h1>
    <a class="button" style="position: absolute; top: 30px; right: 100px;" href="index.html">Home</a>
    <ul id="level-labels">
        <li class="level-label">Level 1</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 2</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 3</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 4</li>
        <li class="level-label">Level 5</li>
    </ul>
    <ul id="level-boxes">
        <li class="level-box">Some safety features, such as lane assist, are included in the vehicle. Adaptive cruise
            control may be included, as well as emergency braking.</li>
        <li class="level-box">Adaptive cruise control and other Level 1 features are included, but blind spot detection,
            automated parking, and sometimes traffic sign recognition are included as well.</li>
        <li class="level-box">Level 3 is what we usually consider "self-driving." The vehicle can accelerate, brake,
            steer, park, navigate traffic signs and signals, and more, using complex algorithms.</li>
        <li class="level-box">Once vehicles reach Level 4 automation, human drivers are rarely needed to take over. They
            can manage complex and difficult situations. Waymo Taxis fit into this category.</li>
        <li class="level-box">With full automation, a human driver is entirely unnecessary. Theoretically, a Level 5
            vehicle can operate safely under any conditions, but no company has reached this stage yet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="position: relative; margin-top: 100px;">Ethical Implications</h3>
    <p>There are quite a few ethical issues to consider related to autonomous vehicles. Importantly, how are the
        safeties of different stakeholders weighed against one another? Some might argue that the safety of the
        driver/passengers is paramount, while others might argue the safety of other drivers or pedestrians are just as
        important. How are we to program this into an autonomous vehicle system?</p><br>
    <p>Furthermore, what if an autonomous vehicle must "decide" whether to stay on course and hit one person or swerve
        out of the way and hit another? Similarly to the trolley car problem, what if it has to decide between hitting
        one person or many? We must consider these questions as we further the technology of autonomous vehicles, hoping
        that the end product will eventually be safer for everybody.</p><br>
    <p>There are other considerations less related to safety as well. Might autonomous vehicles become reliable, safe,
        and ubiquitous enough that human drivers lose their driving jobs? This is a real possibility that could put many
        people out of work. Is it ethical to do so?</p>
